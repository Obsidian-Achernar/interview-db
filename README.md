# Mobile Dev Technical Interview II

Using a technology stack of your choice (React Native will be a plus), create a mobile app, runnable on Android or iOS consisting of a sign-in screen and a dashboard using the UI designs in the assets folder.
The asset folder contains:
- Font
- Graphics
- Screens

## Sign-in Button Functionality
On tapping the sign-in button, make a post request to the endpoint https://my-json-server.typicode.com/obsidian-achernar/interview-db/db
Use the response (in json) to render the dashboard.
